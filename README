TI Codec Engine Test

This code works only in a Rowboat-based Android system:
http://code.google.com/p/rowboat/

With this small example, you can check if TI Codec Engine and TI DMAI API are properly installed.
It also shows how to use the CE_DEBUG and DMAI_DEBUG variables to debug your code.
Another feature is to test if stdio/stderr redirections to the Android logging system work.
